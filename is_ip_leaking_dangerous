it's not bad at all
it doesn't mean much
vpn adds manipulating people

definition of IP

simple on what is a port

IP adr are public 

it's easy to scan all ipV4s on the internet

if your device can be hacked by only knowing it's IP, that means that your device is already screwed

"if you realy beleive a hacker can hack you when they know your IP, you are screwed anyway"

the public IP does not identify ever each device on your network, it only points to the device which is directly connected to the internet i.e: your router

the IP of your router which is assigned by the ISP changes if you restart your router, and it happens automaticly ever regularly (depends on the ISP)

the thread model:

HACKING:

  outdated router that could be hacke

  but if ther is a known exploit on your router, then it may be already hacked, unless your ISP knows about it and it's covering it on their side

PRIVAC:

  people are already sharing their data on social media, informations that I can get from knowing your IP are far less than I can know about you from your social media accounts
